# Moto X3M Level Viewer
 Moto X3M Level viewing tool for seeing triggers and stuff

# How to use:

main.py is the powerhouse of this project, download.py will just download all the levels from og, winter, pool party, and spooky land. 

the directories will look somethink like this:

moto/(1-25).json

winter/(1-25).json

spooky/(1-22).json

pool/(1-22).json

you do not need to put .json after the file name for the program to work.
